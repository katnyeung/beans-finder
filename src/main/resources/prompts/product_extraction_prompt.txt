Extract structured coffee product information from the following content.

Brand: {BRAND_NAME}
URL: {PRODUCT_URL}
Content: {RAW_CONTENT}

Extract and return ONLY a valid JSON object with the following schema:
{
  "product_name": "string (required)",
  "origin": "string (country)",
  "region": "string (specific region or farm)",
  "process": "string (e.g., Washed, Natural, Honey, Anaerobic)",
  "producer": "string (farm or producer name)",
  "variety": "string (coffee variety/cultivar)",
  "altitude": "string (elevation)",
  "tasting_notes": ["array", "of", "strings"],
  "price": number,
  "in_stock": boolean
}

Important rules:
1. Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text
2. If information is not found, use null
3. Normalize process names (e.g., "Honey Anaerobic" not "honey-anaerobic")
4. Extract ALL tasting notes from the content, including:
   - Notes in simple lists (e.g., "blackcurrant, mango, honey")
   - Notes embedded in prose descriptions (e.g., "We're tasting: blackcurrant, blackberry and tomato leaf. In the cup it's unctuous and syrupy - blackcurrant, mango, honey...")
   - Look for sections labeled "Tasting Notes", "We're tasting", "Flavour", "Notes", etc.
   - Extract individual flavor words from descriptive sentences (e.g., from "blackcurrant, blackberry and a hint of tomato leaf" extract ["blackcurrant", "blackberry", "tomato leaf"])
5. Ensure product_name is always populated
6. Clean and standardize values (proper capitalization, no extra whitespace)
